        Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and
        behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of
        the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe
       <br>
            Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of
            astronomy. Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of natural philosophy along with
            mathematics, medicine, chemistry, and various other sciences. In the 17th century, the
            scientific method was introduced, and physics was removed from alchemy and the philosophy of
            nature, becoming a science in its own right. By the 19th century, physics was
            realized as the field of study that deals with the fundamental constituents of the universe,
            the laws governing them, their interactions, and the behavior of systems made up of these
            constituents. In the post-modern era, a new area of research has established itselfâ€”
            physics <br>
            beyond the Standard Model to explain the universe. Physics is one of the oldest academic
            disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the oldest. Over the last two
            millennia, physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry, certain branches of
            mathematics, and biology, but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century, the
            natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right. Physics intersects
            with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and
            the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the
            connections between other scientific disciplines where useful methods or results are
            expected. Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies 
            that arise from theoretical breakthroughs. For example, advances in the understanding of
            electromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that
            have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic
            appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of
            industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.</p>
